# What's this all about, really? #

At the heart of it all, RegExcavate is simply a natural language parser for regex. This is - admittedly - a huge task (bigger than we knew when we started), but it's not an impossible one given that the aim for RegExcavate is to be a learning tool to get beginners started.
